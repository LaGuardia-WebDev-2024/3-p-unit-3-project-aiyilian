    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Wash bok choy thoroughly</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Peel away each individual stem, and toss them into a bowl of large water
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrub your fingers along the bottom of each stem closest to the root.
        Dirt usually accumulates here. Rinse under running water.
      </li>
      <li>If you have time, soak the bok choy in water for 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Dry and trim bok choy</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Drain the bok choy (1 lb) in a colander, and lay them flat onto a towel.
        It's important that the bok choy is dry before stir-frying.
      </li>
      <li>Trim the bok choy by cutting the stalks in half length-wise.</li>
      <li>
        It is optional to seperate the stalks from the leaves, some people
        prefer to cook the stalks first then the leaves
      </li>
    </ul>
 <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Cook garlic and bok choy</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Heat the wok on high heat for 2-3 minutes
      </li>
      <li>While the wok heats up, mince some garlic (2 cloves)</li>
      <li>
        Then, add oil (2 tbsp) until the oil is shimmering, or forming ripples across the surface.
        It's important that the wok and oil get sufficiently hot.
      </li>
    </ul>
     <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Mince garlic and heat wok and oil</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Add the minced garlic, and then the bok choy a few seconds later
      </li>
      <li>While the wok heats up, mince some garlic (2 cloves)</li>
      <li>
        Then, add oil (2 tbsp) until the oil is shimmering, or forming ripples across the surface.
        It's important that the wok and oil get sufficiently hot.
      </li>
    </ul>
